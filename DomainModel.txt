LIFTASTIC

Problems
    for a single exercise on a single training day
        Week 1 - use 80% of 1RM
        Week 2 - increase by 5% (unless you didn't finish week 1)
        Week 3 - deload week, use 70% of 1RM
        Week 4 - back to increase by 5%, but increase based on week 2, not previous week
    Additional considerations
        - If you skip a week (or fail to complete it), the next week should use the previous weeks prescription
            - unless the skipped week was a deload
        - If you skip part of an day, like you completed 1st exercise, but not second
            - next week should increase the 1st exercise
            - but use previous weeks prescription for second exercise
                - unless it was a deload
        - Supersets (2 or more exercises with alternating sets)
        - Alternating weeks
            - Example
                Week 1 - Squat
                Week 2 - Deadlift
                Week 3 - Squat (increase week 1)
                Week 4 - Deadlift (increase week2)
        - Training phases
            - Example
                Week 1 - Squats     Bench
                Week 1 - Squats     Bench
                Week 1 - Squats     Overhead Press
                Week 1 - Squats     Overhead Press
        - Increase reps instead of weight
        - Increase sets instead of weight



Prescriptions
WM = working max = 1 rep max at time of first week
intensity(p) = percentage p of WM
Inc(n, i) = W(n) ? W(n) + i : use W(n)â€™s prescription

example
W1: 70%
W2: W1 ? W1 + 5 : W1
W3: W2 ? W2 + 5 : W2
W4: 60%
W5: W3 ? W3 + 5 : W3
W6: W5 ? W5 + 5 : W5
