Prescriptions
WM = working max = 1 rep max at time of first week
intensity(p) = percentage p of WM
Inc(n, i) = W(n) ? W(n) + i : use W(n)â€™s prescription

example
W1: intensity(70)
W2: Increase(1, intensity(5)) 		# W1 ? W1 + 5 : W1
W3: Increase(2, intensity(5))		# W2 ? W2 + 5 : W2
W4: Repeat(1)					    # W1
W5: Increase(3, intensity(5)) 		# W3 ? W3 + 5 : W3
W6: Increase(5, intensity(5))		# W5 ? W5 + 5 : W5


Set progression templates
